  title: "High-performance Linux monitoring with eBPF"
  description: "Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows for high-performance introspection of the Linux kernel execution. eBPF is widely available (part of the mainline kernel and enabled by most distributions), flexible (any kernel code path can be probed) and safe (driven from userspace and statically verified).

  In this talk, I will introduce eBPF, explaining how it can be used to track TCP connections in real time. On the way I will demonstrate it is possible to access eBPF from languages other than C (Golang) and remove undesirable runtime dependencies (LLVM compiler and kernel-headers).

  At Weaveworks we are using eBPF to implement the next-generation connection-tracker of the Weave Scope visualization tool."

  title: "One API to rule them all, Rise of the Operators"
  description: "During this talk, Ivan will show how to unify all your infrastructure under the same API. He will introduce the concept of operators and custom controllers as the next level of automation. If with config management we automated the provisioning and management of infrastructure, with operators and TPRs (Thirdpartyresources) we can automate the provisioning and maintenance of applications running on that infrastructure.

  Ivan will provide patterns and best practices of how to build, test and run your operators. He will showcase a real life example of how using technologies like Kubernetes, NATS and Prometheus have removed friction and increased velocity to running applications in production."

  description: "This talk will try to cover in different degrees of detail the many different ways in which data can be written to disk, trying to cover as many potential paths as possible, from the user space to the device HW (or lack of thereof in virtual environments)."

  title: "Native, Distributed Storage For Kubernetes"
  description: "Modern software storage systems are inherently complex. They are composed of numerous distributed components, require careful balancing of resources, and have stringent performance requirements. If you're running your applications in a public cloud you're typically shielded from this complexity and can utilize managed storage services like EBS, S3 and EFS. If you're running on-premise, however, your choices are quite limited and typically result in using traditional big-iron storage systems. In this talk, JJ will walkthrough a deploying and running a production-ready storage cluster using Kubernetes. Storage nodes can run as pods and enumerate the available storage devices within the cluster. JJ will show how some of the features of Kubernetes including controllers/operators, third-party resources, resource management, and rolling upgrades can lead to more powerful and resilient storage clusters."

  title: "Booting up your cattle with Ignition and Matchbox"
  description: "Ignition is a tool designed to apply configuration to CoreOS systems early in the boot process. Matchbox matches hardware with the proper templates and renders the specific configuration for a server. Both utilities, used together, become a simple and powerful way to provision hundreds of bare metal servers in a matter of minutes. A brief introduction to these tools will be covered in this talk."
